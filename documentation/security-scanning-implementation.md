# Security Scanning Implementation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the security scanning implementation for the PulsePlus application. The implementation addresses the "No security scanning" finding from the consolidated backend system report.

## Components Implemented

1. **Security Scanner Utility**
   - Created `backend/utils/securityScanner.js` to integrate with AWS Security Hub
   - Provides methods for reporting security findings, vulnerabilities, and issues
   - Configurable through environment variables

2. **Security Scanning Script**
   - Created `scripts/security-scan.js` for running security scans
   - Supports multiple scanning tools:
     - Snyk for dependency vulnerability scanning
     - OWASP ZAP for dynamic application security testing
     - SonarQube for static code analysis
   - Reports findings to AWS Security Hub
   - Configurable to fail builds on critical/high issues

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Updated `buildspec.yml` to include security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline
   - Configured to run scans during the pre-build phase
   - Set up artifact collection for scan reports
   - Added AWS Security Hub integration

4. **Pre-commit Hook**
   - Added `.husky/pre-commit` hook to run security scanning before commits
   - Configured to run Snyk scans on package.json changes
   - Prevents committing code with security vulnerabilities

5. **Documentation**
   - Created `SECURITY.md` with comprehensive documentation
   - Added npm scripts for running security scans

## Configuration

The security scanning implementation can be configured through environment variables:

- `SECURITY_SCANNING_ENABLED`: Set to `true` to enable reporting to AWS Security Hub
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region for Security Hub integration
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: AWS account ID for Security Hub integration
- `SNYK_TOKEN`: API token for Snyk integration

## Usage

### Running Security Scans Locally

```bash
# Run all security scans
npm run security:scan

# Run specific scans
npm run security:scan:snyk
npm run security:scan:zap
npm run security:scan:sonarqube

# Run scans without failing on issues
npm run security:scan:report-only
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The security scanning is automatically run in the CI/CD pipeline as defined in `buildspec.yml`. The pipeline will fail if critical or high severity issues are found.

### Pre-commit Hook

The pre-commit hook automatically runs Snyk scans when changes to package files are detected. This helps prevent introducing vulnerable dependencies.

## Benefits

1. **Early Detection**: Identifies security vulnerabilities early in the development process
2. **Automated Scanning**: Reduces manual effort and ensures consistent scanning
3. **Centralized Reporting**: All findings are reported to AWS Security Hub for centralized management
4. **Compliance**: Helps maintain compliance with security standards and regulations
5. **Developer Awareness**: Increases developer awareness of security issues

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Rules**: Develop custom security rules specific to the application
2. **Expanded Coverage**: Add additional security scanning tools
3. **Security Dashboard**: Create a custom dashboard for security findings
4. **Automated Remediation**: Implement automated remediation for common issues
5. **Security Training**: Integrate with developer training programs

## Conclusion

The implemented security scanning solution provides comprehensive coverage for identifying and managing security vulnerabilities in the PulsePlus application. By integrating security scanning into the development workflow and CI/CD pipeline, we can detect and address security issues early, reducing the risk of security breaches and improving the overall security posture of the application.
