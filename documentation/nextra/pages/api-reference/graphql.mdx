# GraphQL API

PulsePlus provides a GraphQL API for more flexible data querying. This page documents how to use our GraphQL API effectively.

<Callout type="info">
  Our GraphQL API is available at `https://api.pulseplus.com/graphql`
</Callout>

## Getting Started with GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more. Unlike REST APIs, GraphQL APIs have a single endpoint that accepts queries describing the data you want.

### Basic Query Example

Here's a simple query to get a user's information:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    id
    name
    email
    games {
      id
      title
      score
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return only the fields specified (id, name, email, and games with their id, title, and score).

## Authentication

To authenticate with the GraphQL API, include an authorization header with your request:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

## GraphQL Playground

We provide a GraphQL Playground for exploring and testing our GraphQL API:

<div className="mt-8 mb-16 flex flex-col items-center">
  <a 
    href="https://api.pulseplus.com/graphql" 
    className="px-6 py-3 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-purple-700 transition-colors"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    Open GraphQL Playground
  </a>
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-2">Opens in a new tab</p>
</div>

## Key Concepts

### Queries

Queries are used to fetch data. They are similar to GET requests in REST.

```graphql
query {
  games(limit: 10) {
    id
    title
    description
  }
}
```

### Mutations

Mutations are used to modify data. They are similar to POST, PUT, and DELETE requests in REST.

```graphql
mutation {
  createGame(input: {
    title: "New Game",
    description: "A fun new game"
  }) {
    id
    title
    description
  }
}
```

### Subscriptions

Subscriptions allow you to receive real-time updates when data changes.

```graphql
subscription {
  gameScoreUpdated(gameId: "123") {
    gameId
    userId
    score
    timestamp
  }
}
```

## Schema Reference

Our GraphQL schema includes the following main types:

### User

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  games: [Game!]!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}
```

### Game

```graphql
type Game {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
  players: [User!]!
  scores: [Score!]!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}
```

### Score

```graphql
type Score {
  id: ID!
  user: User!
  game: Game!
  value: Int!
  timestamp: DateTime!
}
```
