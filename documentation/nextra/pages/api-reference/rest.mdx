# REST API Reference

This page provides comprehensive documentation for the PulsePlus REST API.

## API Overview

The PulsePlus API follows RESTful principles and uses standard HTTP methods for operations:

- `GET` - Retrieve resources
- `POST` - Create resources
- `PUT` - Update resources
- `DELETE` - Remove resources

All API endpoints return responses in JSON format and use standard HTTP status codes.

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication. The API supports the following authentication methods:

- **Bearer Token** - For user authentication
- **API Key** - For service-to-service authentication

Include the authentication token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

## API Endpoints Overview

Our API is organized around the following main resources:

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate a user and get a JWT token
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh an expired JWT token
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout and invalidate the current token

### Users

- `GET /api/users` - List all users (admin only)
- `GET /api/users/{id}` - Get a specific user
- `PUT /api/users/{id}` - Update a user
- `DELETE /api/users/{id}` - Delete a user

### Games

- `GET /api/games` - List all games
- `POST /api/games` - Create a new game
- `GET /api/games/{id}` - Get a specific game
- `PUT /api/games/{id}` - Update a game
- `DELETE /api/games/{id}` - Delete a game

## Interactive API Documentation

For interactive documentation with the ability to test endpoints, please visit our [Swagger UI](/docs/api/swagger-ui) page.

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. The current limits are:

- 100 requests per minute for authenticated users
- 20 requests per minute for unauthenticated requests

When a rate limit is exceeded, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.

## Versioning

The API is versioned to ensure backward compatibility. The current version is `v1`.

Include the version in the URL path:

```
https://api.pulseplus.com/v1/resources
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. In addition, error responses include a JSON body with more details:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "The requested resource was not found",
    "details": {
      "resourceId": "123",
      "resourceType": "user"
    }
  }
}
```
