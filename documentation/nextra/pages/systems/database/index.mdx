## Database Security and Reliability

PulsePlus implements robust security and reliability features for the database:

1. **SSL/TLS Encryption**
   - All database connections are secured with SSL/TLS
   - Certificate validation and management
   - See [Security and Connections](/systems/database/guides/security-and-connections#ssltls-configuration) for details

2. **Connection Pool Monitoring**
   - Prometheus metrics for connection pool health
   - Query duration tracking
   - See [Connection Pool Monitoring](/systems/database/guides/security-and-connections#connection-pool-monitoring) for details

3. **Transaction Management**
   - Robust transaction utilities
   - Support for different isolation levels
   - See [Transaction Management](/systems/database/guides/security-and-connections#transaction-management) for details

4. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Automated daily, weekly, and monthly backups
   - Point-in-time recovery capabilities
   - See [Backup and Recovery](/systems/database/guides/security-and-connections#backup-and-recovery) for details

5. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Parameterized queries throughout the codebase
   - See [SQL Injection Prevention](/systems/database/guides/security-and-connections#sql-injection-prevention) for details

## Database Conventions

### Primary Keys
- All tables use UUID type for primary keys (sys_id)
- Foreign keys maintain referential integrity
- Consistent naming convention with `sys_id` for primary keys

### Timestamps
- `sys_created_at`: Record creation timestamp
- `sys_updated_at`: Last update timestamp
- All timestamps use TIMESTAMPTZ type for timezone awareness

### Naming Conventions
- Table names: singular, lowercase with underscores
- Column names: lowercase with underscores
- Foreign keys: referenced_table_id format

### Data Types
- Appropriate use of PostgreSQL data types
- JSONB for flexible data structures
- Enums for fixed value sets
