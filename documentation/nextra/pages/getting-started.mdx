# Getting Started with PulsePlus

This guide will help you set up PulsePlus for local development and get familiar with the system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 16.x or later
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git (to clone the repository)

## Quick Start with Docker Compose

The fastest way to get PulsePlus running locally is using Docker Compose:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pulseplus.git
   cd pulseplus
   ```

2. Navigate to the Docker Compose directory:
   ```bash
   cd deployment/docker/compose
   ```

3. Start all services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8080
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8080/api

For more detailed information about the Docker Compose setup, see the [Docker Compose Setup Guide](/operations/docker-compose).

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to run components individually:

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
