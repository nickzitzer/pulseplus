# Security Standards

## Middleware Order

<Callout type="error" emoji="🚨">
  This middleware order is critical and must be followed exactly as specified.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['Requirement', 'Example']}>
  <Tab>
```javascript
// Mandatory middleware order
router.method('/path',
  rateLimiter,      // Rate limiting first
  verifyToken,      // Authentication second
  validateRequest,  // Validation third
  checkPermissions, // Authorization fourth
  businessLogic     // Core functionality last
);
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```javascript
// Example user route
router.post('/users',
  rateLimitPresets.SENSITIVE_OPERATION,
  verifyToken,
  validateRequest(userCreateSchema),
  checkPermission(PERMISSIONS.USER_WRITE),
  async (req, res) => {
    // Create user logic
  }
);
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Headers Configuration

<Tabs items={['Requirements', 'Example']}>
  <Tab>
- All responses must include security headers via Helmet
- CORS must be explicitly configured
- Content Security Policy (CSP) must be enabled
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```javascript
// Use the centralized security configuration
const { securityMiddleware } = require('../config/security');

// Apply security middleware
app.use(securityMiddleware.helmet);
app.use(securityMiddleware.cors);
app.use(securityMiddleware.rateLimit);
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="error" emoji="🚨">
  Never disable security headers for convenience. If you need CSP exceptions, file a security ticket.
</Callout>

## Secrets Management

<Tabs items={['Requirements', 'Example']}>
  <Tab>
- Store sensitive secrets in AWS Secrets Manager for production/staging
- Use environment variables only for development environments
- Implement proper secret rotation mechanisms
- Never hardcode secrets in the codebase
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```javascript
// Retrieve JWT secret based on environment
const getJwtSecret = async () => {
  // In production or staging, retrieve from Secrets Manager
  if (['production', 'staging'].includes(process.env.NODE_ENV)) {
    const secretId = process.env.JWT_SECRET_ID || process.env.DB_SECRET_ID;
    return await getSecretFromSecretsManager(secretId, 'jwt_secret');
  }
  
  // In development, use environment variable
  return process.env.JWT_SECRET;
};

// Use the secret in authentication
const verifyToken = async (token) => {
  const jwtSecret = await getJwtSecret();
  return jwt.verify(token, jwtSecret);
};
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  JWT secrets and API keys must be stored in AWS Secrets Manager in production environments. No exceptions.
</Callout>

## Password Policy

The PulsePlus application implements a comprehensive password policy to ensure user account security:

### Password Requirements

- Minimum length: 12 characters
- Must contain at least one uppercase letter
- Must contain at least one lowercase letter
- Must contain at least one number
- Must contain at least one special character
- Cannot contain repeating characters (3 or more of the same character in sequence)
- Cannot contain common sequential patterns (e.g., "abc", "123")

### Password Expiration and History

- Passwords expire after 90 days
- Users cannot reuse any of their 5 previous passwords
- Users are prompted to change their password upon expiration
- New passwords must be different from the previous ones

### Account Lockout

- Accounts are locked after 5 consecutive failed login attempts
- Lockout duration is 30 minutes
- Administrators can manually unlock accounts if needed
- Failed login attempts are reset after a successful login

### Implementation Details

The password policy is enforced at multiple levels:

1. **Database Level**: The database schema includes fields for tracking password updates, failed login attempts, and account lockout status.

2. **Service Level**: The `UserService` validates password strength, manages password history, and handles account lockout.

3. **Middleware Level**: The `passwordPolicyMiddleware` enforces password expiration and validates password strength for all relevant endpoints.

4. **API Level**: All authentication endpoints implement the password policy rules.

## Authentication

Authentication in PulsePlus is handled through JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with the following security measures:

- Tokens are signed with a secure algorithm (HS256)
- Access tokens have a short expiration time (15 minutes)
- Refresh tokens are used for obtaining new access tokens
- Tokens can be revoked in case of security concerns
- All authentication attempts are logged for security auditing

## Authorization

PulsePlus implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system:

- Each user is assigned a role (e.g., user, admin, gamemaster)
- Roles have specific permissions
- Middleware checks permissions before allowing access to protected resources
- API endpoints are protected based on required permissions

## Data Protection

Sensitive data is protected through:

- Encryption of sensitive data at rest
- Secure transmission over HTTPS
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Output encoding to prevent XSS attacks
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## Security Headers

The application sets the following security headers:

- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Strict-Transport-Security
- Referrer-Policy

## CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is implemented through:

- CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations
- Same-site cookie attributes
- Origin validation

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse:

- Global rate limiting for all API endpoints
- Stricter rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- IP-based and user-based rate limiting
- WebSocket connection rate limiting

## Security Logging and Monitoring

Security events are logged and monitored:

- Failed login attempts
- Password changes
- Account lockouts
- Permission changes
- Administrative actions

## Regular Security Audits

The application undergoes regular security audits:

- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- Code reviews focused on security
- Penetration testing
