## Overview

PulsePlus follows a set of standardized patterns and practices to ensure consistency, maintainability, and reliability across the codebase. These standards help developers understand the codebase more quickly and make it easier to add new features or fix bugs.

By following these standards, we can:

1. Reduce cognitive load when switching between different parts of the codebase
2. Ensure consistent error handling and logging
3. Maintain proper transaction support across the application
4. Implement caching consistently
5. Make the codebase more maintainable and easier to test
6. Ensure accessibility and performance standards are met

Please refer to the specific sections for detailed guidelines on each aspect of development.
