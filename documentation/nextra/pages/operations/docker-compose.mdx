# Docker Compose Setup

## Overview

PulsePlus can be run locally using Docker Compose, which sets up all the necessary services in containers. This guide explains how to use Docker Compose for local development and testing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git (to clone the repository)

## Services Architecture

The Docker Compose setup includes the following services:

1. **nginx**: Web server that routes traffic to the frontend and backend services
2. **frontend**: Next.js application serving the user interface
3. **backend**: Node.js API server
4. **db**: PostgreSQL database
5. **redis**: Redis for caching and session management

## Configuration

The Docker Compose setup uses environment variables from a `.env` file located at `deployment/docker/config/.env`. This file contains configuration for:

- Port mappings
- Service URLs
- Database credentials
- Redis settings
- Email configuration
- JWT secrets
- And more

### Example .env Configuration

```env
# PORTS
FRONTEND_PORT=8080
BACKEND_PORT=3001

# URLS
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080/api

# Backend variables
JWT_SECRET=test_jwt_secret_key_for_local_testing
SESSION_SECRET=test_session_secret_key_for_local_testing
NODE_ENV=development
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://pulseplus-admin:Work4PulsePlus1@db:5432/pulseplus_db

# Docker configuration
FRONTEND_IMAGE=pulseplus-frontend:latest
BACKEND_IMAGE=pulseplus-backend:latest
DB_IMAGE=postgres:13-alpine

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=test_redis_password_for_local_testing

# Email
SMTP_HOST=localhost
SMTP_PORT=25
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=dummy_user
SMTP_PASS=dummy_password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@localhost
```

## Running Docker Compose

To start all services using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Navigate to the Docker Compose directory
cd deployment/docker/compose

# Start all services in detached mode
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
1. Build or pull all required Docker images
2. Create a Docker network for service communication
3. Start all services with the configured environment variables
4. Set up health checks to ensure services are running properly

## Accessing the Application

Once all services are running, you can access:

- Frontend: http://localhost:8080
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080/api (through nginx)
- Direct backend access: http://localhost:3001 (if needed)

## Service Health Checks

The Docker Compose configuration includes health checks for all services:

- **nginx**: Checks if the `/health` endpoint is accessible
- **frontend**: Basic port check to ensure the service is running
- **backend**: Checks if port 3001 is accessible
- **db**: Uses `pg_isready` to verify database availability
- **redis**: Uses `redis-cli ping` to verify Redis availability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email Configuration Errors**

   The backend requires SMTP configuration for email functionality. For local development, dummy values are sufficient:

   ```env
   SMTP_HOST=localhost
   SMTP_PORT=25
   SMTP_SECURE=false
   SMTP_USER=dummy_user
   SMTP_PASS=dummy_password
   SMTP_FROM=noreply@localhost
   ```

   Note that with this configuration, emails won't actually be sent, but the application will start without validation errors.

2. **Container Health Check Failures**

   If containers are marked as "unhealthy":

   ```bash
   # Check container logs
   docker logs compose-backend-1
   docker logs compose-frontend-1

   # Check container status
   docker-compose ps
   ```

3. **Port Conflicts**

   If ports are already in use on your system, modify the port mappings in the `.env` file.

## Stopping Docker Compose

To stop all services:

```bash
# Stop all services but keep volumes
docker-compose down

# Stop all services and remove volumes (will delete database data)
docker-compose down -v
```

## Development Workflow

For local development with Docker Compose:

1. Make changes to your code
2. Rebuild the affected service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build frontend  # or backend
   ```
3. Restart the service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --no-deps frontend  # or backend
   ```

This allows you to test changes without restarting the entire stack.

## Resource Limits

The Docker Compose configuration includes resource limits for each service:

- **nginx**: 0.5 CPU, 256MB memory
- **frontend**: 1 CPU, 1GB memory
- **backend**: 1 CPU, 1GB memory
- **db**: 1 CPU, 1GB memory
- **redis**: 0.5 CPU, 256MB memory

These limits can be adjusted in the `docker-compose.yml` file if needed for your development environment.
