## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm (v7 or later)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pulseplus.git
   cd pulseplus
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```
   npm run install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example` file:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Update the `.env` file with your specific configuration values, including database credentials and API keys.

3. Generate environment-specific files and ECS task definitions:
   ```
   npm run generate-env
   ```

## Database Setup

1. Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running.

2. Create a new database for PulsePlus.

3. Run the database setup script:
   ```
   npm run rebuild-db
   ```

This script will create the necessary tables and insert initial data.

## Running the Application

1. Start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Development

- To run the frontend in development mode:
  ```
  cd frontend
  npm run dev
  ```

- To run the backend in development mode:
  ```
  cd backend
  npm run dev
  ```

## Deployment

1. Build the Docker images:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Push the images to your container registry (e.g., ECR for AWS):
   ```
   docker push your-registry/pulseplus-frontend:latest
   docker push your-registry/pulseplus-backend:latest
   ```

3. Deploy using your preferred method (e.g., ECS, Kubernetes, etc.)

## Architecture Overview

The infrastructure consists of:

- **VPC Configuration**
  - Multi-AZ deployment (2 AZs)
  - Public, Private, and Isolated subnets
  - NAT Gateways for outbound traffic

- **Compute (ECS Fargate)**
  - Frontend Service (Next.js)
  - Backend Service (API)
  - Auto-scaling configuration
  - Container insights enabled

- **Database**
  - Amazon RDS PostgreSQL 13
  - Automated backups
  - Encrypted storage
  - Private subnet deployment

- **Security**
  - HTTPS/TLS encryption
  - WAF with rate limiting
  - Security groups for network isolation
  - Secrets management for sensitive data
  - HTTP to HTTPS redirection

- **Monitoring**
  - CloudWatch alarms for CPU and error rates
  - Container insights
  - Access and application logging

## Prerequisites

1. AWS CLI installed and configured
2. Node.js 14.x or later
3. AWS CDK CLI installed (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
4. Domain name registered in Route53
5. Docker installed (for building container images)

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Domain**
   - Ensure your domain is registered in Route53
   - Note the hosted zone ID

3. **Build Docker Images**
   ```bash
   # Build frontend image
   docker build -t pulseplus-frontend ./frontend
   
   # Build backend image
   docker build -t pulseplus-backend ./backend
   ```

4. **Deploy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Bootstrap CDK (first time only)
   cdk bootstrap

   # Deploy the stack
   cdk deploy --parameters domainName=your-domain.com --parameters environment=production
   ```

5. **Push Docker Images**
   ```bash
   # Login to ECR
   aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com

   # Tag and push frontend
   docker tag pulseplus-frontend:latest <frontend-repo-uri>:latest
   docker push <frontend-repo-uri>:latest

   # Tag and push backend
   docker tag pulseplus-backend:latest <backend-repo-uri>:latest
   docker push <backend-repo-uri>:latest
   ```

## Infrastructure Details

### Networking
- VPC with 3 subnet tiers (Public, Private, Isolated)
- 2 NAT Gateways for high availability
- Application Load Balancer in public subnets
- Services and database in private/isolated subnets

### Compute
- Frontend Service:
  - Memory: 1024 MiB
  - CPU: 512 units
  - Auto-scaling: 2-10 tasks
  - Scale on 70% CPU utilization

- Backend Service:
  - Memory: 1024 MiB
  - CPU: 512 units
  - Auto-scaling: 2-10 tasks
  - Scale on 70% CPU utilization

### Database
- Instance: t3.small
- Multi-AZ: No (upgrade for production if needed)
- Backup retention: 7 days
- Storage: Encrypted at rest
- Automated backups enabled

### Security
- WAF Rules:
  - Rate limiting: 2000 requests per IP
  - Customizable rule sets available

- SSL/TLS:
  - ACM-managed certificates
  - Automatic HTTPS redirection
  - Modern security protocols

### Monitoring
- CloudWatch Alarms:
  - High CPU utilization (90% threshold)
  - HTTP 5xx errors (10 errors threshold)
  - Custom metrics available through Container Insights

## Environment Variables

### Frontend
- `FRONTEND_PORT`: Port for the frontend service (default: 3000)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL`: Frontend URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`: Backend API URL
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment name

### Backend
- `BACKEND_PORT`: Port for the backend service (default: 3001)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment name
- `POSTGRES_HOST`: Database host (auto-configured)
- `POSTGRES_PORT`: Database port (auto-configured)
- `POSTGRES_DB`: Database name
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing secret (from Secrets Manager)
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Session secret (from Secrets Manager)
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password (from Secrets Manager)

## Cost Optimization

Consider the following for cost optimization:
- NAT Gateway count can be reduced to 1 for non-production environments
- RDS instance size can be adjusted based on workload
- Auto-scaling parameters can be tuned based on usage patterns
- Reserved instances can be purchased for predictable workloads

## Troubleshooting

1. **Certificate Validation**
   - Ensure DNS validation records are created
   - Wait for certificate validation (can take up to 30 minutes)

2. **Database Connectivity**
   - Check security group rules
   - Verify subnet connectivity
   - Check credentials in Secrets Manager

3. **Service Health**
   - Monitor ECS service events
   - Check container logs in CloudWatch
   - Verify health check endpoints

## Support

For issues and support:
1. Check CloudWatch logs
2. Review ECS service events
3. Check security group configurations
4. Verify DNS records
5. Monitor ALB target group health

## Security Considerations

1. Rotate database credentials regularly
2. Monitor WAF rules and adjust as needed
3. Review security group rules periodically
4. Keep container images updated
5. Monitor CloudWatch logs for suspicious activity

## Future Enhancements

Consider these potential improvements:
1. Multi-AZ RDS deployment
2. Additional WAF rules
3. Enhanced monitoring and alerting
4. Disaster recovery configuration
5. Blue/Green deployment setup
