## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm (v7 or later)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pulseplus.git
   cd pulseplus
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```
   npm run install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example` file:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Update the `.env` file with your specific configuration values, including database credentials and API keys.

3. Synchronize environment variables to frontend, backend, and deployment directories:
   ```
   npm run sync-all-env
   ```
   
   This script copies the relevant environment variables from the root `.env` file to:
   
   - **Frontend directory**: Variables from SHARED and FRONTEND-SPECIFIC sections
   - **Backend directory**: Variables from SHARED and BACKEND-SPECIFIC sections
   - **Docker Compose directory**: All variables for containerized deployment
   
   The root `.env` file is organized into three sections:
   
   - **SHARED CONFIGURATION**: Variables used by both frontend and backend
   - **FRONTEND-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION**: Variables used only by the frontend
   - **BACKEND-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION**: Variables used only by the backend
   
   Always edit the root `.env` file and then run `npm run sync-all-env` to propagate changes. The generated `.env` files are auto-generated and should not be edited directly.

4. Generate environment-specific files and ECS task definitions:
   ```
   npm run generate-env
   ```

## Database Setup

1. Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running.

2. Create a new database for PulsePlus.

3. Run the database setup script:
   ```
   npm run rebuild-db
   ```

This script will create the necessary tables and insert initial data.

## Running the Application

1. Start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```
   npm run docker:up
   ```
   This command automatically synchronizes environment variables before starting the containers.

2. Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend at `http://localhost:3001`.

3. Other Docker Compose commands:
   ```
   npm run docker:down     # Stop all containers
   npm run docker:build    # Rebuild all containers
   npm run docker:restart  # Restart all containers
   ```
   All these commands ensure environment variables are synchronized before execution.

## Development

- To run the frontend in development mode:
  ```
  cd frontend
  npm run dev
  ```

- To run the backend in development mode:
  ```
  cd backend
  npm run dev
  ```

## Deployment

1. Build the Docker images:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Push the images to your container registry (e.g., ECR for AWS):
   ```
   docker push your-registry/pulseplus-frontend:latest
   docker push your-registry/pulseplus-backend:latest
   ```

3. Deploy using your preferred method (e.g., ECS, Kubernetes, etc.)

  - ACM-managed certificates
  - Automatic HTTPS redirection
  - Modern security protocols

### Monitoring
- CloudWatch Alarms:
  - High CPU utilization (90% threshold)
  - HTTP 5xx errors (10 errors threshold)
  - Custom metrics available through Container Insights

## Environment Variables

### Frontend
- `FRONTEND_PORT`: Port for the frontend service (default: 3000)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL`: Frontend URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`: Backend API URL
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment name

### Backend
- `BACKEND_PORT`: Port for the backend service (default: 3001)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment name
- `POSTGRES_HOST`: Database host (auto-configured)
- `POSTGRES_PORT`: Database port (auto-configured)
- `POSTGRES_DB`: Database name
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing secret (for development/test environments only)
- `JWT_SECRET_ID`: ARN of the AWS Secrets Manager secret containing the JWT secret (REQUIRED for production/staging)
- `DB_SECRET_ID`: ARN of the AWS Secrets Manager secret containing database credentials (for production/staging)
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Session secret (from Secrets Manager in production)
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Database password (from Secrets Manager in production)

### Secrets Management

In production and staging environments, sensitive configuration values like JWT secrets and database credentials are stored in AWS Secrets Manager. The application will automatically retrieve these secrets at startup.

For local development, you can use the `.env` file with plaintext values. In production, the following environment variables should be set:

- `JWT_SECRET_ID`: ARN of the secret containing the JWT signing key (REQUIRED in production/staging)
- `DB_SECRET_ID`: ARN of the secret containing database credentials

The secrets should be structured as JSON objects with the following keys:
```json
{
  "username": "db-username",
  "password": "db-password",
  "jwt_secret": "jwt-signing-secret",
  "session_secret": "session-secret"
}
```

## Cost Optimization

Consider the following for cost optimization:
- NAT Gateway count can be reduced to 1 for non-production environments
- RDS instance size can be adjusted based on workload
- Auto-scaling parameters can be tuned based on usage patterns
- Reserved instances can be purchased for predictable workloads

## Troubleshooting

1. **Certificate Validation**
   - Ensure DNS validation records are created
   - Wait for certificate validation (can take up to 30 minutes)

2. **Database Connectivity**
   - Check security group rules
   - Verify subnet connectivity
   - Check credentials in Secrets Manager

3. **Service Health**
   - Monitor ECS service events
   - Check container logs in CloudWatch
   - Verify health check endpoints

## Support

For issues and support:
1. Check CloudWatch logs
2. Review ECS service events
3. Check security group configurations
4. Verify DNS records
5. Monitor ALB target group health

## Security Considerations

1. Rotate database credentials regularly
2. Monitor WAF rules and adjust as needed
3. Review security group rules periodically
4. Keep container images updated
5. Monitor CloudWatch logs for suspicious activity
6. Rotate API keys for external services regularly using the built-in API key rotation mechanism

## API Key Management

PulsePlus includes a secure API key management system that handles storage and rotation of API keys for external services:

1. **Secure Storage**: All API keys are stored in AWS Secrets Manager in production/staging environments
2. **Automatic Rotation**: API keys are automatically rotated based on configurable intervals (default: 30 days)
3. **Fallback Mechanism**: During rotation, both current and previous keys are maintained to ensure service continuity
4. **Admin Interface**: Administrators can manage API keys through the admin interface

### API Key Rotation Configuration

Configure API key rotation in your environment:

```
# API Key Rotation Configuration
API_KEY_ROTATION_ENABLED=true
API_KEY_ROTATION_INTERVAL=30 # days
API_KEY_SECRET_PREFIX=pulseplus/api-keys
```

### Managing API Keys

Administrators can manage API keys through the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/admin/api-keys` - List all API keys
- `GET /api/admin/api-keys/:serviceName` - Get API key metadata for a specific service
- `POST /api/admin/api-keys/rotate` - Rotate an API key
- `POST /api/admin/api-keys/register` - Register a service for API key rotation
- `POST /api/admin/api-keys/rotate-all` - Force rotation of all registered API keys

## Future Enhancements

Consider these potential improvements:
1. Multi-AZ RDS deployment
2. Additional WAF rules
3. Enhanced monitoring and alerting
4. Disaster recovery configuration
5. Blue/Green deployment setup

## Documentation

PulsePlus comes with comprehensive documentation built using [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), a Next.js-based documentation framework. All documentation has been consolidated into a single Nextra deployment for easier maintenance and access.
