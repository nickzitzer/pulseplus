I'll convert the page guide into a markdown table format for easier reading and tracking of completion status. I'll structure the table with columns for:

1. Page Name
2. Route
3. Purpose
4. Key Components
5. Access Level
6. Implementation Status (which the user can use to check off items as they complete them)

I'll organize the tables by the main sections that I already laid out in the previous response, maintaining the same structure but in a more scannable table format.
