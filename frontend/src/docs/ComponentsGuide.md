:::thinking
I'll add a "Status" column to all tables in the component library. Since I don't have information about which components have already been built, I'll use a generic status placeholder like "Not Started" as the default, which can be updated as components are implemented.

For each component table, I'll:
1. Add a "Status" column
2. Set the default value to "Not Started"
3. Ensure the table formatting remains clean and readable

## Implementation Priorities

When implementing components, follow this priority order to maximize value and functionality:

1. **Core System & UI Framework Components**: These provide the foundation for all other components
2. **Authentication & User Profile Components**: Essential for user identity and access
3. **Key Gamification Components**: Core engagement drivers (Achievements, Leaderboard, Quests)
4. **Economy Components**: Direct reward systems have high engagement impact
5. **Competition Components**: Competitive elements drive achievement-oriented users
6. **Season Components**: Seasonal content drives regular return visits
7. **Social Components**: Social features increase retention
8. **Power-up Components**: Enhance the user experience with special abilities
9. **Analytics Components**: Data visualization increases user understanding and goal-setting
10. **Admin Components**: Management interfaces for platform administrators

## Design Guidelines

All components should follow these design principles:

### Naming Conventions
- Use the established PulsePlus prefix for all components
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `PulsePlusLeaderboard`)
- Use camelCase for props and internal variables

### File Structure
```
/components
  /core
  /ui
  /gamification
  /social
  /economy
  /competition
  /admin
  /analytics
  /season
  /powerup
```

### Code Guidelines
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props and state
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Include accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Optimize for performance, especially for real-time components
- Use React hooks for state management over class components
- Include comprehensive documentation and examples

### Visual Design
- Maintain consistent styling with the design system
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Use appropriate animations for state changes (subtle, purposeful)
- Follow accessibility contrast guidelines
- Support both light and dark themes
- Use consistent spacing and typography

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for component relationships
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing for complex components
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

### Status Tracking Guide

Use the following status indicators for tracking component development:

- **Not Started**: Component is defined but development hasn't begun
- **In Progress**: Component is currently under development
- **Review**: Component is complete and awaiting code review
- **Testing**: Component is under QA testing
- **Complete**: Component is fully implemented and production-ready
- **Deprecated**: Component has been replaced or is no longer needed

By following these guidelines and implementation priorities, the PulsePlus platform will maintain consistency, scalability, and a high-quality user experience throughout its development.
