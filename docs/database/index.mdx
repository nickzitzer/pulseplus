## Database Conventions

### Primary Keys
- All tables use UUID type for primary keys (sys_id)
- Foreign keys maintain referential integrity
- Consistent naming convention with `sys_id` for primary keys

### Timestamps
- `sys_created_at`: Record creation timestamp
- `sys_updated_at`: Last update timestamp
- All timestamps use TIMESTAMPTZ type for timezone awareness

### Naming Conventions
- Table names: singular, lowercase with underscores
- Column names: lowercase with underscores
- Foreign keys: referenced_table_id format

### Data Types
- Appropriate use of PostgreSQL data types
- JSONB for flexible data structures
- Enums for fixed value sets
